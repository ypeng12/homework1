What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

In the process, rebase flattens the history, removing unwanted entries. 
Git merge, on the other hand, only changes the target branch and creates a commit, 
preserving the history of the source branch.


What is a remote repository?


A remote repository is a version control repository that is hosted on a server and accessed over a network by developers and collaborators. This repository can be located on a cloud-based platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, or on a private server. Developers can clone or download the contents of the remote repository to their local machine, make changes to the code, and then push those changes back to the remote repository for others to access and review.

Remote repositories are a key component of distributed version control systems like Git, which enable teams of developers to collaborate on code projects from anywhere in the world. By hosting code in a central location, remote repositories provide a single source of truth for the project and enable developers to manage changes to the codebase more effectively.
